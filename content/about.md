Hi, you have found my blog[^1] where I post all things that might help someone in their web development journey.

My name is Julian Markiewicz and I am Poland based web developer mainly writing code in javascript or javascript frameworks (like angular2 or vuejs). I also try to do some backend (node.js) stuff because I find building a whole website from A to Z interesting. I am a big fan of open source. Have been using linux for last few years as a daily driver. I try to write articles about coding and contribute to the community.

In my spare time, I try to keep up with constant changes and novelties in JS. But when I'm not fighting with JS I watch movies üçø (especially South Korean ones that somehow manage to surprise me every single time)[^2] and bake breads üçû.

If you found a bug or want to talk, feel free to reach me at markiewicz.julian@gmail.com

[^1]: This website was build with Hugo, using [hugo-theme-hello-friend](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) and [hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) themes with minor tweaks here and there.
[^2]: if you don't believe me watch these three movies: [Parasite](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/), [Train to Busan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5700672/) and [The man from nowhere](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1527788/)
